  Over <strong>four themed days</strong>, the summer school guides participants through the key challenges and opportunities at the intersection of data science, AI, and society. The program opens with an introduction to the SoBigData Research Infrastructure, followed by the presentation of real-world social challenges proposed by companies and associations, which will inspire the projects developed by students throughout the week. The second day focuses on Health and Wellbeing, exploring the intersection of AI and healthcare, personal wellbeing, and health data through advanced data analysis and visualization techniques. The third theme, Sport Analytics and Agentic AI, examines data-driven approaches in soccer and volleyball alongside emerging agentic AI methods. The final day addresses Privacy and Fairness, for understanding how to handle data and modelling solutions as a responsible data science.

  Expert led <strong>morning lectures</strong> expose participants to state-of-the-art methodologies and real-world case studies, emphasizing best practices and contemporary applications of big data and AI. Afternoon sessions are dedicated to <strong>collaborative group projects</strong>, enabling hands-on learning and practical problem solving. At the end of the week, a panel of experts in data science and AI evaluates the projects, ensuring a comprehensive and interactive learning experience that equips participants to address technical, ethical, and societal challenges in data-driven innovation.
